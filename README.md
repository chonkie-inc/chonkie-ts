</div>

We built `chonkie-ts` while developing a TypeScript web app that needed fast, on-the-fly text chunking for RAG applications. After trying several existing libraries, we found them either too heavy or not flexible enough for our needs. `chonkie-ts` is a port of the original `chonkie` library, but with some type-safety and a few extra features to make it more useful for TypeScript developers!

**üöÄ Feature-rich**: All the CHONKs you'd ever need </br>
**‚ú® Easy to use**: Install, Import, CHONK </br>
**‚ö°  Fast**: CHONK at the max speed of TypeScript! tssssooooooom </br>
**ü™∂ Light-weight**: No bloat, just CHONK </br>
**ü¶õ Cute CHONK mascot**: psst it's a pygmy hippo btw </br>
**‚ù§Ô∏è [Moto Moto](#acknowledgements)'s favorite TypeScript library** </br>

**Chonkie** is a chunking library that "**just works**" ‚ú®

> [!NOTE]
> This library is not a _binding_ but a _port_ of the original `chonkie` library written in Python, to TypeScript. This library is still under active development and not at feature parity with the original `chonkie` library yet. Please bear with us! ü´Ç

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install @chonkiejs/core
```

## üìö Usage

```typescript
import { RecursiveChunker } from '@chonkiejs/core';

// Create a chunker
const chunker = await RecursiveChunker.create({
  chunkSize: 512
});

// Chunk your text
const chunks = await chunker.chunk('Your text here...');

// Use the chunks
for (const chunk of chunks) {
  console.log(chunk.text);
  console.log(`Tokens: ${chunk.tokenCount}`);
}
```
