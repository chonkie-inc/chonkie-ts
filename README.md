</div>

Maaaaaan, i was building a typescript web app for myself which had RAG and I wanted to chunk my texts on the fly, fast. i kinda didn't enjoy using the other libraries out there, either to heavy or not flexible enough, so i just built this one.  ü¶õ‚ú®

**üöÄ Feature-rich**: All the CHONKs you'd ever need </br>
**‚ú® Easy to use**: Install, Import, CHONK </br>
**‚ö°  Fast**: CHONK at the speed of TypeScript! zooooom...? (lol) </br>
**ü™∂ Light-weight**: No bloat, just CHONK </br>
**ü¶õ Cute CHONK mascot**: psst it's a pygmy hippo btw </br>
**‚ù§Ô∏è [Moto Moto](#acknowledgements)'s favorite TypeScript library** </br>

**Chonkie** is a chunking library that "**just works**" ‚ú®

## üì¶ Installation

Simply install Chonkie using npm:

```bash
npm install chonkie
```

Chonkie believes in having minimum default dependencies, and maximum flexibility, and so we have a lot of optional dependencies that you can opt out of if you don't need them. You can get the minimal install by running:

```bash
npm install chonkie --no-optional
```

Learn more about the optional dependencies in the [DOCS.md](./DOCS.md) file.

## üìö Usage

Chonkie is a simple and easy to use library for chunking text. It is designed to be used in any project that needs to chunk text, and is a great way to get started with text chunking.

```ts
import { TokenChunker } from 'chonkie';

async function main() {
  // Create a token chunker with default options
  const chunker = await TokenChunker.create();

  // Chunk a string
  const chunks = await chunker.chunk('Woah! Chonkie is such a great ts library!');

  // Print the chunks
  for (const chunk of chunks) {
    console.log(chunk.text);
    console.log(chunk.token_count);
  }
}

main();
```

## Chunkers 

`chonkie-ts` is currently a work in progress and does not have feature parity with the original `chonkie` library yet. Here's an overview of the chunkers that are currently implemented:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `TokenChunker` | Splits text into fixed-size token chunks |
| `SentenceChunker` | Splits text into chunks based on sentences.  |
| `RecursiveChunker` | Splits text hierarchically using customizable rules to create semantically meaningful chunks. |
